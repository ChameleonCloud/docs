Activating a FutureGrid Project
===============================

All FutureGrid projects have been entered into Chameleon, but they must
be activated before they can be used. Only the Project Manager or Lead
of the FutureGrid project can claim it in Chameleon. If you are a member
of a project you will be able to view the project information and we
will provide you links to contact the Manager/Lead if you would like to
see the project migrated.

After `activating your Chameleon account <../accounts>`__, visit the
FutureGrid@Chameleon page to view the FutureGrid projects that are
available for migration. Migrated projects are queued for fast-track
approval so that users can continue working on Chameleon.

After migrating a project, you will be provided with a list of the
former members of the project on FutureGrid. If these users have an
account on Chameleon it is a one-click process to add them back to the
project on Chameleon. For users that don’t already have a Chameleon
account, you can easily invite those users to create an account on
Chameleon.
