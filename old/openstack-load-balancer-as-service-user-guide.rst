OpenStack Load Balancer as a Service User Guide
===============================================

The OpenStack networking component, Neutron, includes a Load Balancer as
a Service (LBaaS). This service lets you configure a load balancer that
runs outside of your instances and directs traffic to your instances. A
common use case is when you want to use multiple instances to serve web
pages and meet performance or reliability goals.

Chameleon currently provides the OpenStack Neutron LBaaS service on
Alamo for use with virtual machine instances. This service uses
`HAProxy <http://www.haproxy.org/>`__ as the load balancer.

Configure Instances
-------------------

To begin, we will create and configure three instances that will serve
web traffic. Please see the `Alamo User Guide <../alamo-user-guide>`__
for additional information on how to create and configure instances.

First, create a security group that allows SSH and HTTP traffic. Second,
create three instances from the CentOS-7 image. We’ll call these
instances server-1, server-2, and server-3. Third, assign a public
floating IP address to server-1. Your configuration should now resemble:

Next, ssh to server-1 and configure it by (replace all IP addresses
below with the ones allocated to your instances):

::

    $ ssh -A cc@129.114.32.26
    [cc@server-1 ~]$ sudo yum install httpd
    [cc@server-1 ~]$ sudo systemctl enable httpd.service
    [cc@server-1 ~]$ sudo systemctl start httpd.service
    [cc@server-1 ~]$ sudo sh -c "echo server 1 > /var/www/html/index.html"

If you visit http://129.114.32.26 in your web browser, you will see
‘server 1’

From server-1, ssh to the private IP addresses of server-2 and server-3
and configure them similarly:

::

    [cc@server-1 ~]$ ssh 192.168.0.62
    [cc@server-2 ~]$ sudo yum install httpd
    [cc@server-2 ~]$ sudo systemctl enable httpd.service
    [cc@server-2 ~]$ sudo systemctl start httpd.service
    [cc@server-2 ~]$ sudo sh -c "echo server 2 > /var/www/html/index.html"
    [cc@server-2 ~]$ exit

    [cc@server-1 ~]$ ssh 192.168.0.63
    [cc@server-3 ~]$ sudo yum install httpd
    [cc@server-3 ~]$ sudo systemctl enable httpd.service
    [cc@server-3 ~]$ sudo systemctl start httpd.service
    [cc@server-3 ~]$ sudo sh -c "echo server 3 > /var/www/html/index.html"
    [cc@server-3 ~]$ exit

Your three instances are now ready to start serving trivial http
requests. For the rest of this guide, you do not need a public IP
address for server-1, so you can disassociate it from server-1.

Configure Load Balancer
-----------------------

Now that we have instances, we can configure a load balancer to route
traffic to them. This is primarily accomplished via the `Load
Balancer <https://horizon.chameleon.tacc.utexas.edu/dashboard/project/loadbalancers/>`__
page that you can navigate to under Project -> Network in the left menu.

First, in the “Pools” tab, select the “Add Pool” button on the right
side of the page. Pick a name and enter an optional description. The
only provider that is currently available is haproxy. Select the private
subnet for your project, not the subnet that is used for public IP
addresses (129.114.32.0/23). For this example, select the HTTP protocol
and the ROUND\_ROBIN load balancing method:

|Picture|

Select Add and your pool is created and the Status should be ACTIVE:

|Picture|

Next we’ll add the instances you created earlier to your pool. Select
the “Members” tab and then “Add Member”. On the dialog, select your pool
and all of the members you want to add. Give all of the selected members
the same weight of 1 (you can change this later or add members one at a
time with different weights) and enter 80, the HTTP port:

|Picture|

Click “Add” and you should see all three members of your pool with
Status ACTIVE:

|Picture|

Now we allocate an internal Virtual IP (VIP) address for the load
balancer. In the Pools tab, select the arrow to the right of your pool
and then pick “Add VIP”. In the dialog, pick a name and an optional
description. Then select one of your private subnets to creat the VIP on
and pick an available IP address on that subnet. Finally, set a port of
80 and the HTTP protocol. For this example, you do not need session
persistence, but there are several different methods available if you
need them. Once you’ve entered this information:

|Picture|

Click “Add” and your load balancer is now listening on that IP address.
To access the load balancer from outside of your private subnet, you
must assign a floating IP address to it. Go to the Floating IPs tab of
the `Access and Security
page <https://horizon.chameleon.tacc.utexas.edu/dashboard/project/access_and_security/>`__,
pick an IP address and select “Associate”:

|Picture|

Pick the port for your VIP - it should have a name of “None” and then
the VIP you selected above. Click “Associate” and you should then see
that floating IP is mapped to your Load Balancer VIP:

|Picture|

If you navigate to that floating IP in your web browser, you should get
a resonse of “server X”, were X can be 1, 2, or 3. Furthermore, if you
reload that page, you should get a different “server Y”. Your load
balancer is now operational.

Add a Health Monitor
--------------------

An important feature of a load balancer is that it can determine if a
server has failed and route traffic away from it. The OpenStack Neutron
LBaaS supports this functionality by allowing you to define Monitors in
the Monitor tab of the `Load
Balancer <https://horizon.chameleon.tacc.utexas.edu/dashboard/project/loadbalancers/>`__
page. Select “Add Monitor” and then specify a monitor that you would
like to add. For example, you can define a monitor that GETs a page
every minute and if that fails twice, stop sending traffic to that
instance:

|Picture|

Once a monitor is defined, you associate it with your pool via the
“Associate Monitor” item in the menu to the left of your pool in the
Pools tab. You now have a load balancer with back end instances that are
being checked to ensure that they are operating propertly.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

As with all OpenStack services, you can manage load balancers from the
command line if you install the needed OpenStack client packages. In
addition to using the nova client program to manage instances, you use
the neutron client program to manage the load balancer configuration and
manage floating IP addresses.

The steps to configure a load balancer via command line programs are the
same as the steps as described in the web interface above. At a high
level, you will:

#. ``nova boot`` to create the instances
#. ``neutron lb-pool-create`` to create the pool
#. ``neutron lb-member-create`` to add each instance as a member
#. ``neutron vip-create`` to create a Virtual IP address and associate
   it with your pool
#. ``neutron floatingip-associate`` to associate a floating IP address
   to your Virtual IP
#. ``neutron lb-healthmonitor-create`` to create the health monitor
#. ``neutron lb-healthmonitor-associate`` to associate the heath monitor
   with your pool

The `RedHat LBaaS
page <https://openstack.redhat.com/LBaaS#Create_the_load_balancer>`__
provides more detailed examples of these commands including their
arguments.
