Hotel User Guide
================

Overview
--------

OpenStack is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform that allows
you to create and manage virtual environments. Currently, OpenStack
version 2013.2 (Havana) is available on Hotel.

An important note is that the OpenStack install on Hotel uses the KVM
virtualization technology, so any virtual machines you upload must be
compatible with KVM.

This tutorial provide basic information about how to use the OpenStack
web interface and provides some information specific to using OpenStack
on Hotel.

Web Interface (Horizon)
-----------------------

An easy way to use OpenStack on Hotel is via `the OpenStack web
interface on Hotel <https://openstack.uc.chameleoncloud.org/>`__. You
log in to the web interface using your Chameleon username and password.
If you change your Chameleon password in the portal, that change will
propagate to the OpenStack interface on Hotel in less than an hour.

The initial log in page appears as:

After a successful log in, you will see the Overview page as shown
below. This page provides a summary of your current and recent usage and
provides links to various other pages. Most of the tasks you will
perform are done via the menu on the lower left and will be described
below. One thing to note is that on the left, your current project is
displayed. If you have multiple Chameleon projects, you can change which
of them is your current project. All of the information displayed and
actions that you take apply to your current project. So in the screen
shot below, the quota and usage apply to the current project you have
selected and no information about your other projects is shown.

Managing Virtual Machine Instances
----------------------------------

One of the main activities you’ll be performing in this web interface is
the management of virtual machines, or instances. You do this via the
Instances page that is reachable from the menu in the lower left of the
Overview page. An example Instances page is shown below. For instances
that you have running, you can click on the name of the instance to get
more information about it and to access the VNC interface to the
console. The dropdown menu to the left of the instance lets you perform
a variety of tasks such as suspending, terminating, or rebooting the
instance.

|Picture|

The Instances page also lets you create new virtual machines by using
the ‘Launch Instance’ button in the upper-right. When you click this
button, a dialog window pops up. In the first ‘Details’ tab, you select
the ‘Instance Boot Source’ of the instance, which is either an ‘Image’,
a ‘Snapshot’ (an image created from a running virtual machine), or a
‘Volume’ (a persistent virtual disk that can be attached to a virtual
machine). If you select ‘Boot from image’, the Image Name dropdown
presents a list of virtual machine images that we have provided, that
other Chameleon users have uploaded and made public, or images that you
have uploaded for yourself. If you select ‘Boot from snapshot’, the
Instance Snapshot dropdown presents a list of virtual machine images
that you have created from your running virtual machines.

On the Details tab, you also provide a name for this instance (to help
you identify instances that you are running), and select the amount of
resources (Flavor) to allocate to the instance. If you select different
flavors from the Flavor dropdown, their characteristics are displayed on
the right.

The next tab is ‘Access & Security’ where you select an SSH keypair that
will be inserted into your virtual machine. These keypairs can be
uploaded via the main ‘Access & Security’ section. If you had a
FutureGrid account you should also find the SSH public keys that you
uploaded via the FutureGrid portal. You will need to select a keypair
here to be able to access an instance created from one of the public
images Chameleon provides. These images are not configured with a
default root password and you will not be able to log in to them without
configuring an SSH key.

Once you do this, you can Launch your instance and the Instances page
will show progress as it starts.

Snapshots
---------

The instance list page shown above has an option ‘Create Snapshot’ that
allows you to save a copy of the disk contents of a running virtual
machine. This allows you to start new virtual machines in the future
that are identical to this one and is an easy way to save any changes
you make to a running virtual machine.

Floating IP Addresses
---------------------

The OpenStack cloud on Hotel assigns both a public and a private IP
address to each virtual machine. These virtual machines can thus be
SSH’ed to from your workstation without further configuration. You can
also access them using VNC in the OpenStack web interface. By default,
only the SSH port (TCP port 22) and ICMP traffic are authorized.

To enable more traffic, you need to configure the security group used by
your virtual machine. You can see a list of your security groups using
the “Access & Security” link on the left.

|Picture|

To edit a security group, click on “Edit Rules”. This opens a page
showing the existing rules in the security group.

|Picture|

Then, click on “Add Rule” and enter the protocol (by default TCP) and
the port number that you want to authorize. Finally, click on Add to
save the new rule. Modifications are automatically propagated to the
OpenStack cloud.

Accessing Your Virtual Machine
------------------------------

There are two ways you can access your virtual machine. One way is you
can access the console using Virtual Network Computing (VNC) in the
OpenStack web interface. If you navigate to the Instances page using the
left menu and select your instance, you will see a tab VNC that has this
console.

The second way is via SSH. When you created your virtual machine, you
specified an SSH key to load in to the VM. OpenStack injects this SSH
key into the VM and you can use the corresponding private SSH key to log
in to the VM. You will need to use the public IP assigned to your VM to
connect from outside of the Hotel cluster.

**An important note is that many of the images that we provide do not
allow you to SSH into the root account. Instead, you SSH into a
different account and use passwordless sudo for any administrative
tasks. For Ubuntu images, you SSH in to the ‘ubuntu’ account. For CentOS
and Fedora 18 and older Fedora images, you SSH in to the ‘ec2-user’ and
for Fedora 19 and newer, you SSH in to the ‘fedora’ user.**

OpenStack REST Interfaces
-------------------------

The OpenStack REST Interfaces are supported on Hotel over secure HTTP
connections. You can download your OpenStack credentials file from the
web interface via the “Access & Security” link in the left of any page
and then click on the “API Access” link on the top.

The SSL certificate used by OpenStack Hotel is trusted by most operating
systems, so you shouldn’t have to provide any extra options to OpenStack
commands, i.e. “nova list” should work.

If your command-line tool complains about the certificate, `download the
Mozilla CA bundle from the cURL
website <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html>`__ and run the
OpenStack client tools with the –os-cacert cacert.pem arguments.

EC2 Interface
-------------

OpenStack on Hotel supports the EC2 interface for programmatic access.
You can download your EC2 credentials from the web interface via the
“Access & Security” link in the left of any page and then click on the
“API Access” link on the top. You should see a ‘Download EC2
Credentials’ button on the top-right. Note that you have different EC2
credentials for each Chameleon project you participate in. If you are a
member of multiple Chameleon projects, we request that you use the
corresponding EC2 credentials when starting virtual machines for a
project.

Note that the S3 interface is not currently available, but you can
access the OpenStack Swift object store using the native API.
