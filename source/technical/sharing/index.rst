====================
Trovi Sharing Portal
====================

`Chameleon Trovi <https://www.chameleoncloud.org/experiment/share>`_ is a
sharing portal that allows you to share digital research and education
artifacts, such as packaged experiments, workshop tutorials, or class materials.
Each research artifact is represented as a deposition (a remotely accessible
folder) where a user can put Jupyter notebooks, links to images, orchestration
templates, data, software, and other digital representations that together
represent a focused contribution that can be run on Chameleon. Users can use
these artifacts to recreate and rerun experiments or class exercises on a
Jupyter Notebook within Chameleon. They can also create their own artifacts and
publish them directly to Trovi from within :ref:`Chameleon's Jupyter server
<jupyter>`.

To get started, find the "Trovi" dropdown option under the "Experiment" section
of chameleoncloud.org. Once you're on the Trovi homepage, you'll see a list of
publicly available experiments and other digital artifacts. You can now browse
those artifacts or upload your own.
