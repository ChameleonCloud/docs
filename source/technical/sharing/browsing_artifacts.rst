Browsing artifacts
==================

Trovi allows you to browse artifacts, presented in a scrolling list format. On
the right hand side, there are multiple filtering options. The
"All" choice shows you all of the artifacts you have access to. You can also see
how many times people have downloaded and launched your notebook with the icons
in the bottom left corner of an artifact.

.. note::

   Some Trovi artifacts are supported by the Chameleon team and are denoted
   with a small Chameleon logo. You can contact the |Help Desk| if you are
   using these artifacts and encounter issues.

Launching an artifact
---------------------

The most powerful feature available via Trovi is the ability to re-launch the
available artifacts within Chameleon. Clicking "Launch with JupyterHub" will
open a new Jupyter Notebook server with the artifacts downloaded (we support
artifacts up to 500MB in total size, contact the |Help Desk| if you need
more space). The animation below shows how easy it is:

   Clicking the "Launch with JupyterHub" button to import a Trovi artifact into
   your own Jupyter server.
