Complex Appliances in the Catalog
=================================

The `Chameleon Appliance Catalog <https://www.chameleoncloud.org/appliances/>`_ has several *Complex Appliances* for popular technologies that people want to deploy such as OpenStack or MPI or even more advanced deployments such as efficient SR-IOV enabled MPI in KVM virtual machines. We also provide common building blocks for cluster architectures, such as an NFS share. *Complex Appliances* are identified by a badge in their top-right corner representing a group of machines, as in the screenshot below:
