Sharing Complex Appliances
==========================

If you have written your own *Complex Appliance* or substantially customized an existing one, we would love if you shared them with our user community! The process is very similar to regular appliances: log into the Chameleon portal, go to the appliance catalog, and click on the button in the top-right corner: *Add an appliance* (you need to be logged in to see it).

You will be prompted to enter a name, description, and documentation. Instead of providing appliance IDs, copy your template to the dedicated field. Finally, share your contact information and assign a version string to your appliance. Once submitted, your appliance will be reviewed. We will get in touch if a change is needed, but if it's all good we will publish it right away!
