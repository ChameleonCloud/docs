=============================
Command Line Interface (CLI)
=============================

Introduction
============

The Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a way to interact with Chameleon resources using shell and scripting tools. Chameleon uses the `OpenStack Client <https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/>`_ to provide CLI functionality. This documentation section provides an overview on how to install the client and configure your shell environment to access Chameleon features.

.. attention::
    Some of the Chameleon features are **only** accessable via the CLI, such as the Gnocchi metrics and the advanced networking features.

.. note:: Chameleon Cloud is primarily designed to support Unix-like environments. Threfore, it is highly recommended using CLI in a Unix-like system. For Windows 10 users, you may want to enable `Windows Subsystem for Linux <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>`_ to get better experience with the Chameleon CLI.

.. _cli-installing:

Installing the CLI
==================

Prerequisites
-------------

#. **Python** - Check if you have Python installed.
#. **PIP** - If youâ€™re using Python 2.7.9 (or greater) or Python 3.4 (or greater), then PIP comes installed with Python by default.

OpenStack Client Installation
-----------------------------

#. Install the CLI by typing ``pip install python-openstackclient`` in the terminal.
#. Verify that it has installed correctly by typing ``openstack``. You will enter the Openstack Client in interactive mode and your prompt should change to ``(openstack)``.
#. Exit the client by typing ``exit``.

.. _cli-authentication:

CLI authentication
==================

When using the CLI, you have to provide some credentials so the system trusts that the operations are really being executed by your user account. There are two ways of doing this.

.. NOTE(jason): [federation] change to 'setting a cli password'

Using your Chameleon password
-----------------------------

The simplest way to authenticate is to use your Chameleon password. However, this can come with some security risk; if you accidentally commit your CLI code with your password included in to source control, an attacker would know your password and could potentially take over your account (or other accounts that share the same password.) Be sure you never commit your :ref:`RC files <cli-rc-script>` in to source control for this reason.

.. _cli-application-credential:

Creating an application credential
----------------------------------

You can also generate *application credentials*, which act as dedicated one-off passwords that are authorized with the same permissions as your user account, within a single project. If you work on multiple projects simultaneously, you will need to
generate one application credential for each project.

To create an application credential, navigate to the "Identity" dashboard in the :ref:`gui`, and go to the "Application Credentials" panel. Create a new application credential and name it something meaningful (such as "CLI access for project CH-XXX"). **You will also need to check the "unrestricted" checkbox in order to use the CLI to make leases in Blazar**. If you do not need to make reservations via the CLI, you can leave the box unchecked, as it is the safer option.

Once the system generates the credential, you will be given the option to download an :ref:`RC file <cli-rc-script>` that configures the CLI to use the application credential for authentication. You will only see the secret credentials once, so make sure to save the RC file or the secret somewhere, as if it's lost, you will have to delete the credential and create a new one.

.. _cli-rc-script:

The OpenStack RC Script
=======================

You must use the *OpenStack RC Scripts* to configure the environment variables for accessing Chameleon features. You can downloaded the script from the Chameleon GUI at the :ref:`gui-api-access`.

#. Log in to the GUI at |CHI@TACC| or |CHI@UC|.

   .. important::

       Download the RC file from the site you would like to interact with. The RC files are different for each site.

#. Select the project you wish to access via :ref:`gui-project-menu`.

#. Download *OpenStack RC Script* using :ref:`gui-user-menu` by clicking on *Openstack RC File v3*.

   .. figure:: cli/userdropdown.png

#. Run the following command in the terminal:

   .. code-block:: shell

       source <path/to/openstack_rc_file>

   .. note::

       The command **will not** work for Windows users. Skip this step and the next step if you are using Windows system.

#. Enter your password when prompted.
#. For macOS/Linux users, your current terminal session has been configured to access your project. Now type ``openstack`` in your terminal session.

   For Windows users, you have to provide the environment variables in the *OpenStack RC* script as ``openstack`` command parameters. Run the following command in your Windows prompt:

   .. code-block:: shell

       openstack --os-auth-url <OS_AUTH_URL> \
       --os-project-id <OS_PROJECT_ID> \
       --os-project-name <OS_PROJECT_NAME> \
       --os-user-domain-name <OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME> \
       --os-username <OS_USERNAME> \
       --os-password <OS_PASSWORD> \
       --os-region-name <OS_REGION_NAME> \
       --os-interface <OS_INTERFACE> \
       --os-identity-api-version <OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION>

   Replace values of the parameters by reading from the *OpenStack RC* script.

   Another way to configure the OpenStack client for Windows users is to add/edit environment variables manually via *System Properties* window. Then, click on *Environment Variables...* button and manually add/edit the environment variables in *OpenStack RC Script*  to *Environment Variable* window.

   .. note::

      For macOS/Linux users, every time when open a new terminal, you have to run the ``source`` command to access the OpenStack client.

   .. error::

      If you get authentication error, check if you input your password correctly.

#. Type ``project list`` at the ``(openstack)`` prompt. You should see a list of the projects you belong to.

   .. error::

      If you get permission error at this step, please check that 1) the terminal session has been configured correctly with the environment variables; 2) the *OpenStack RC* script you ``source`` is **v3**; 3) the OpenStack client version is the latest. To check the OpenStack client version, use ``openstack --version`` command. Some older versions may cause errors.

   .. error::

      If you get the ``Missing value`` error when using a command, it is likely that your terminal session has not been configured correctly and completely with the environment variables. The error may be fixed by re-running the ``source`` command over the OpenStack RC Script or using the command line switches.


Using the CLI
=============

You can use the CLI in either Interactive Mode or Shell Mode. In either mode, the OpenStack client has to be configured by using the *OpenStack RC Script* or by providing the command line switches. For more information about the usage of the OpenStack client, run ``openstack --help``.

Interactive Mode
----------------

The Interactive Mode allows you to use the ``openstack`` commands through an interactive prompt. To start the Interactive Mode, type ``openstack`` in the configured terminal. Once entering the Interactive Mode, you will see a ``(openstack)`` prompt. Type the command you would like to run at the prompt. To find out the commands, type ``help``.

Shell Mode
----------

Each CLI command can be used in your terminal exactly the same way that it appears in the Interactive Mode, simply by preceding the command with ``openstack``. For example, the command ``image list`` in the Interactive Mode is equivalent to the command ``openstack image list`` in the Shell Mode.
