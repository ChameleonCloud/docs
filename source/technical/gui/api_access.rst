API Access
==========

The API Access page lists all the available REST APIs that are used for
configuring the :ref:`cli`. In addition, you may download :ref:`cli-rc-script`
scripts via this page.

.. note::

   Typically, the key generated from your computer will be at
   ``~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``. On Mac OS X, you can run in a terminal: ``cat
   ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy``. It copies the content of the public key to your
   copy/paste buffer. Then you can simply paste in the "Public Key" box.
