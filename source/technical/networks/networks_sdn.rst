Software Defined Networking
===========================

.. warning::
   Openflow SDN support is currently not available at the CHI@UC or CHI@TACC sites, due to failures in the Corsa switches that
   supported this feature.

In the meantime
---------------

.. note::
   We will be restoring some support once our "Reservable Switch" feaure goes live. In the meantime, the FABRIC testbed can
   used for networking experiments, and Chameleon supports :ref:`stitching` and :ref:`multisitelayer3` to FABRIC.
