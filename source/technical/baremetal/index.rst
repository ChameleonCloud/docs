Bare metal instances
=====================

Bare metal instances on Chameleon provide you with exclusive access to physical hardware resources. This allows you to run experiments with full control over the compute environment, from the hypervisor level down to the bare metal. Bare metal instances are ideal for systems research, performance evaluation, and experiments that require specific hardware features or configurations.

Before launching an instance, make sure you own a lease. About how to create a
lease, see :ref:`reservations`. Once your lease is started, you are
almost ready to start an instance. But first, you need to make sure that you
will be able to connect to it by setting up :ref:`gui-key-pairs`.
