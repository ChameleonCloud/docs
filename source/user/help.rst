Getting Help
============

Chameleon offers several support channels to assist users with their
questions and issues. Depending on the nature of your inquiry, you can choose
from the following options:

Community Forum
===============

.. note::
   For immediate assistance or urgent issues, use the Help Desk rather 
   than the community forum. The Help Desk ensures your request receives prompt 
   attention from Chameleon staff.

Join the `Chameleon Community Forums <https://forum.chameleoncloud.org/>`_ to connect 
with other users, ask questions, and share experiences. The forum provides a space for:

* User discussions and community support
* Non-urgent questions about using Chameleon
* Sharing best practices and experimental approaches
* Announcements of new features and capabilities

The forum is actively monitored by Chameleon staff and experienced community members 
who provide assistance on a best-effort basis. For immediate help or urgent issues, 
use the Help Desk instead.
