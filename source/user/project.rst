Each individual *Project* has its own:

- Service Unit allocations

- System resources such as *Security Groups*, *Floating IP Addresses* and
  *Instances*
- Assets such as snapshots, object containers, metrics and network configuration

Creating a Project

.. _service-units:

Service Units
-------------

One Service Unit (SU) is equivalent to one hour of usage of one allocatable
resource (physical hosts, network segments, or floating IPs). For example, a
reservation for 5 Skylake compute nodes for 8 hours would use 40 SUs. However,
for certain types of resources, more SUs will be charged. For more details about
allocation charges, please see `here

.. _manage-roles:

Manage User Roles (PI Delegate)
-------------------------------

To manage user roles of a *Project*, use the *Project Members* section in the 
:ref:`project-details`. The table below shows the types of roles and their
privileges. 

+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Role    | Description                                                               |
+=========+===========================================================================+
| PI      | Each project has only one PI. PI can manage roles of the project members. |
+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Manager | Each project can have multiple Managers. Managers can manage the          | 
|         | membership and renew allocations of the project.                          |
+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Member  | Members can only view the list of the project members.                    |

user row, and then click *Change Role*. It will enable the role dropdown.

.. _manage-users:

Manage Users
------------

To manage users of a *Project*, use the *Project Members* section in the
:ref:`project-details`. While each user has their own Chameleon User account
independent of your project, they may be added to one or more projects. Being a
user of a *Project* **does not** require a :ref:`PI eligibility
<pi-eligibility>`.

You may add a user to your project by filling out their user name or email
address and clicking the *Add user* button. You may remove a user from your
project by locating the user in the user list; clicking the *gear* button
at the end of the row; and clicking *Remove user*.

It is possible to bulk-add a large list of users by clicking the "Add multiple users"
button, or remove all users without the Manager role by clicking the "Remove multiple users"
button. Additionally, under this option there is a link which you can send to
users which will allow them to request to join your project. Once a request is made,
the managers of a project will be notified, and will need to confirm the user.

If there is no user associated with an email address, an invitation will be sent
with a link. When someone clicks on this link, they will be prompted to sign in
or create an account, and then automatically added to the project. Invitations
show up at the bottom of the members list, and can be deleted or resent if needed.
After an invitation is accepted, the user will show up under the *Project Members*
section.
