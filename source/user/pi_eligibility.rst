PI eligibility
===============

Chameleon PIs carry significant responsibility for the users on their projects;
we therefore limit PI eligibility to individual from the following groups:

- **Academic institutions**: This eligibility criterion covers research
  scientists or faculty members in those institutions.
- **Federal agencies such as national labs, R&D centers, and institutes**:
  Research staff employed by federal agencies or non-NSF Federally Funded R&D
  Centers (FFRDCs) are eligible to apply for an allocation.
- **International research institutions**: to promote intellectual exchange and
  federation with institutions abroad we support a limited number of
  international PIs with ongoing, active collaborations with scientists in the
  US.
- **NSF Graduate Student Fellows**: While in most cases, a graduate student is
  ineligible to be PI of an allocation request, an exception is made for NSF
  Graduate Student Fellows. Recipients of these NSF awards can submit requests
  for Startup allocations as long as they include supporting documentation
  (grant number or an award letter) as part of the request submission.
- Independent museums, observatories, libraries, research laboratories,
  professional societies and similar organizations in the United States that are
  directly associated with educational or research activities are eligible.
- State educational offices or organizations and local school districts may
  submit allocation requests intended to broaden the impact, accelerate the
  pace, and increase the effectiveness of improvements in science, mathematics,
  and engineering education in both K-12 and post-secondary levels. A teacher or
  educator at an accredited public or private K-12 school is eligible to apply
  for an allocation as PI.

We do occasionally provide case-by-case exceptions to this guideline in
well-justified cases.
